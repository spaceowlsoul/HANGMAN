HANGMAN

A well-known game welcomes you!

Please, enter 'play' to start playing the game.
The computer will randomly choose the word you need to guess.

In the beginning, you have eight lives.
If you enter the correct letter, you can guess further.
If you are wrong, the hangman will take one of your lives.
If you enter a nonEnglish letter, symbol, number, or an empty line, the computer will ask you to put a letter again (without decreasing your lives).

You will win if you have guessed the word and have at least one life left.
Otherwise, you will lose.
Having finished your session, you can continue playing by entering 'play', or you can leave the game by putting 'exit'.

Good luck and try to stay alive!
